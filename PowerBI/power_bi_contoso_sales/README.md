# Contoso Analytics Dashboard

This project was completed by following Bence Borbély’s 3-week Power BI course.

### What I practiced

- Enriching data in Power Query by creating custom and conditional columns  
- Designing a star schema data model  
- Writing DAX formulas for custom measures  
- Building interactive dashboards and visual reports
- Implementing row-level security roles (e.g., filtering data for Europe)
